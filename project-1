Context & Existing Research
I wanted to understand the current problem space and the pain points users had regarding Enterprise and Premium plan adoption. Here are the key takeaways:

Customer perspective
“One of the problems I have with the word ‘enterprise’ is it’s unclear... Am I an enterprise?”
Enterprise is a buzzword that has an unclear definition across companies. 

Atlassian (our) perspective
“People say ‘I need Enterprise - 50 users.’ Why do you think that is what you need?”
Customers with very low user tiers that don’t qualify for Enterprise frequently ask for Enterprise benefits. Sales team members wish for a quiz to help customers determine plan fit. 

Personas
To help understand and fully empathize with our target audience(s), two user personas were created. 
Our primary users are customers migrating from Server to Cloud, who ultimately are unsure about what Enterprise plans entail and if Premium or Enterprise better suits their needs. This is especially important given the cost and benefit differences between both plans. However, we also have to consider our secondary users: growing Standard plan customers looking for a plan suiting their needs.
